## 3. Data Storage

### 3.1 Local Storage

By default, all your data (IPTV sources, playlists, favorites, settings) is stored **locally on your device**. This means:
- Your data never leaves your device unless you explicitly enable cloud sync.
- You have full control over your data.
- No internet connection is required to access your locally stored information.

### 3.2 Cloud Storage (Premium Feature)

If you subscribe to Genova Premium and enable cloud sync:
- Your synchronized data is stored securely on our servers.
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- You can disable cloud sync at any time, which will stop syncing but may not immediately delete data from our servers (see section on data deletion).

## 4. Data Sharing and Third Parties

- **No Sale of Data**: We do not sell your personal information to third parties.
- **Service Providers**: We may use trusted third-party services for:
  - Analytics (anonymized usage data)
  - Cloud infrastructure (for Premium cloud sync)
  - Payment processing (for Premium subscriptions)
  - These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights and safety.

---

## 5. Data Security

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:
- **Encryption**: Data in transit is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
- **Local Encryption**: Sensitive data stored locally is encrypted.
- **Secure Servers**: Cloud data (if applicable) is stored on secure, encrypted servers.
- **Access Controls**: Limited access to user data, only for necessary operations.

However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
